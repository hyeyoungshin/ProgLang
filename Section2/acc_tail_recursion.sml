(* More of tail recursion:

- Where reasonably elegant, feasible, and important, rewriting functions to be tail-recursive can be much more efficient
 - Tail-recursive: recursive calls are tail-calls

- There is a methodology that can often guide this transformation
 - Create a helper function that takes an accumulator
 - Old base case becomes initial accumulator
 - New base case becomes final accumulator

(* Another example:

                                 fun sum xs = 
                                    case xs of
                                        [] => 0
                                       | x::xs' => x + sum xs' 



                                 fun sum xs = 
                                     let fun aux (xs, acc) = 
                                            case xs of 
                                               [] => acc
                                             | x::xs' => aux(xs', x+acc)
                                      in
                                          aux(xs,0)
                                      end

(* And another

                                 fun rev xs =
                                    case xs of
                                 	[] => []
                                      | x::xs' => (rev xs') @ [x]


				 fun rev xs =
                                     let fun aux(xs, acc) =
                                 	     case xs of
                                 		 [] => []
					       | x::xs' => acc(xs', x::acc)
				     in
					 aux(xs, [])
				     end
	
 *)
















(* Actually much better:


                                    fun rev xs =
                                       case xs of
                                            [] => []
                                          | x::xs' => (rev xs) @ [x]



- For fact and sum, tail-recursion is faster but both ways linear time

- Non-tail recursive rev is quadratic because each recursive call uses append, which must traverse the first list
 - And 1+2+..l+(length-1) is almost length*length/2
 - Moral: beware list-append, especially within outer recursion

- Cons constant-time (and fast), so accumulator version much better
